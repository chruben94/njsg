            Welcome to U.S. Swimming Group(USSG). 
            USSG is founded by a group of former Korean Olympic swimmers who have the experience and 
            knowledge to guide students on their path to become a competitive swimmer or a swim coach and also to 
            help more general group of students to learn and enjoy swimming. 
            Our coaches use the teaching method of both Korean and US swim teams, which creates great synergies..
            </p>

            Our certified coaches participated in Olympic games, Asian games and other International Swimming 
            competitions and have more than 10 years of coaching experience. We teach a broad range of student 
            groups including youth beginners, students aiming for a swimming scholarship for a college, and adults 
            with recreation purposes.

            swim clubs in many levels. We provide the most efficient and well-structured lessons. USSG offer four 
            types of programs: individual, group, competitive swim team and synchronized swimming. We always make
